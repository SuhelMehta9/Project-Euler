# Project-Euler
It contains the python program that are solution to the problems that are on https://projecteuler.net/archives
The programes that I created as a solution to the problems are working fine but they can be developed and how they can much more efficiently are written as comment in the respective programs.
The programs might not be the best approach to problems but if they are giving output that user requires then they are ok for me.
